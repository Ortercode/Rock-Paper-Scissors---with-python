# Rock-Paper-Scissors---with-python

Lol I tried doing this with C++. I hated it.
I think I'll follow the advice given to me by 
my friends to not learn C++ straight away.
Ive kinda been stubborn with this. 
I'll just be making some stuff with JS and Python
from now on. I'll dabble with C++ a bit but it wont
be my main focus.
